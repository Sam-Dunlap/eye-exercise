Eyeball Project

The eyes follow your mouse. They also stare deeply into your soul.

This project runs out of a web browser - no installation necessary. If you want to clone and download this repository, you can run it from that folder by dragging index.html to your browser window.

In the future I might make the eyes smaller and make a lot more of them. Thousands of eyes, following you around menacingly... I would also like to add eyebrows and a nose to the eyes.
